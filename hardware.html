<p> A PVC enclosure and plastic standoffs were used to reduce weight. A rotary potentiometer was used to replicate a volume knob, while 4-pin 
  push buttons were used for device control. The LCD screen, audio codec and SJ One board use a +5V input being fed from a +5V power rail. A 
  +5V micro usb breakout is used to supply a constant +5V from a 3000mAh power bank. Since pins on the SJ One board are only +3.3V tolerant, a +3.3V power rail is used in conjunction
  to avoid extra components.  
  Each button and potentiometer use +3.3V input from the +3.3V rail being sourced by the SJ One board.  </p>

<p> Connections were made by soldering each component on the PCB for the button interface, 
while 30 AWG wire was chosen for wire wrapping the interfacing the screen, microprocessor and codec. </p>
